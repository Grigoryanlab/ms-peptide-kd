       ‘ms_allData3.xlsx’ is the datasets obtained from mass spectrometry which includes peptide sequences and corresponding intensities. It contains five independent datasets (different peptide library or different experimental settings). 

       ‘Kd_FP_sum.xlsx’ is the peptide affinity validation data using FP.

       ‘analyzeMS.ms’ is the main script of the PEDAL method. It reads in the data file ‘ms_allData3.xlsx’ and output an csv file containing Kd, estimated error, observed error, number of occurrences, alpha and x correlation value of each unique peptide; it then reads in datafile ‘Kd_FP_sum.xlsx’ and another script ‘plotFpMsKd.m’ to plot the affinities from PEDAL assay against the affinities from FP assay for a group of peptides.  
	
       ‘best.txt’ is the best estimation of Kd for each unique sequence identified from all four peptide libraries.   

       ‘cluster_seqs.m’ reads in ‘best.txt’ and perform t-SNE analysis of all the peptides included.
